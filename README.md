# Keywords lib

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd keywords-lib/
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `keyword-lib` directory in your code editor of choice. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Add new keywords with associated docs**

    To create new keywords, create a new markdown file in `src/keywords-docs`.

    The markdown you will write here will be the content of the corresponding post.
    Each content file has a _frontmatter_ in `yaml` syntax.

    A keyword post can have the following front matter fields :
    ```yaml
    title: Title # The title of your post (REQUIRED)
    tags: # List of tags (free from any restrictions, it's only words)
      - Tag1 # Tags names
      - Tag2
    sources:  # List of sources used for this keyword definition
      - http://wikipedia.org # urls directly
    related:  # List of related posts
      - Post1 # Posts titles (the `title` key in the related post's frontmatter)
      - Post2
    authors:  # List of authors for this post (even if only one author)
      - Author1 # Author username (the `username` key in the author's frontmatter)
    ```

1. **Add your author's info**

    To create new authors, create a new markdown file in `src/authors`

    The markdown you will write here will be the description used for your author's page.
    Each author file has a _frontmatter_ in `yaml` syntax.

    An author post can have the following front matter fields :
    ```yaml
    username: My Username # Your username, currently also used as your display name (REQUIRED)
    avatar: http://url.to/avatar # Url to the avatar you want to use. If omitted, a random one will be generated each time (OPTIONAL)
    ```

# Gatsby's README

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
